# Prototype
Source code available [here](https://github.com/caranha/BordeauxTsukuba2017/tree/master/Prototype).
## Description
The only purpose of this program is to show you the basic gameplay of our future game. It is written in Lua using LÖVE framework. Even if we provide you the code of the game, it is only a question of security for you if you don't want to execute something not verified or "compiled" by yourself. The code is really dirty and was made in 2 weeks, but as said before, the purpose is for you to have an overview of our game and for us to have your feedbacks.
