# Imagining a game
## Finding a type of game

---

<!-- *footer: Imagining a game - Finding a type of game -->

### 5 ideas
* Music game :musical_note:
* Arcade game :joystick:
* Narrative/Interactive game :book:
* Rogue like :old_key:
* RPG :crossed_swords:

---

<!-- *footer: Imagining a game - Finding a type of game -->

### The one we picked :
**Narrative/Interactive  game :**
* Story > Gameplay
* Story forked at some points
* Player makes decisions
* Can be played again to obtain different outcomes

---

<!-- *footer: Imagining a game - Finding a type of game -->
### Finding the verbs
* RPG-like controls (move up, down, left, right)
* Interact with entities
* Enter a building
* Choose answer in a dialogue

# Developing a game
## Developing the engine
**5 weeks**

---
<!-- *footer: Developing a game - Developing the engine -->

Already existing interactive novel engines :
* Twine (Javascript)
* Ren' Py (Python)
* Interact (.NET) 

---
<!-- *footer: Developing a game - Developing the engine -->

### Why develop our own engine ?
* Specific controls
* Graphics
* World (with entities and interactions)

---
<!-- *footer: Developing a game - Developing the engine -->

### Our engine : 
* Tiled map (.tmx)
* XML dialogue files
* Asset manager
* Scene system

# Developing a game
## Outlining the scenes
**2 weeks**

---
<!-- *footer: Developing a game - Outlining the scenes -->

### What is a scene ?
* Setup -> Obstacle -> Goal
* Independent
