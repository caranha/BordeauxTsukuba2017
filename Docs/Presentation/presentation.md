# Imagining a game
## Finding a type of game

<!-- *footer: Imagining a game - Finding a type of game -->
### 5 ideas
* Music game
* Arcade game
* Narrative/Interactive game
* Rogue like
* RPG

---

<!-- *footer: Imagining a game - Finding a type of game -->
### The one we picked :
**Narrative/Interactive  game :**
* Story > Gameplay
* Story forked at some points
* Player makes decisions
* Can be played again to obtain different outcomes

---

<!-- *footer: Imagining a game - Finding a type of game -->
### Finding the verbs
* RPG-like controls (move up, down, left, right)
* Interact with entities
* Enter a building
* Choose answer in a dialogue

# Imagining a game
## Prototyping

---

<!-- *footer: Imagining a game - Prototyping -->
### The tools
**Framework :** LÖVE 2D (Lua)
**For the sprites :** Piskel
**For the map edition :** Tiled
**For the tileset :** pokemonfangames.deviantart.com

<!-- *footer: Imagining a game - Prototyping -->
### The prototype scene

1. Story description
2. Events
3. Dialogues

# Developing a game
## Developing the engine
**5 weeks**

---
<!-- *footer: Developing a game - Developing the engine -->
Already existing interactive novel engines :
* Twine (Javascript)
* Ren' Py (Python)
* Interact (.NET) 

---
<!-- *footer: Developing a game - Developing the engine -->
### Why develop our own engine ?
* Specific controls
* Graphics
* World (with entities and interactions)

---
<!-- *footer: Developing a game - Developing the engine -->
### Our engine : 
* Tiled map (.tmx)
* XML dialogue files
* Asset manager
* Scene system

# Developing a game
## Outlining the scenes
**2 weeks**

---
<!-- *footer: Developing a game - Outlining the scenes -->
### Making scenes independent
* Knows which scene to load next
* Doesn't care about the previous ones

# What we learned
## Tools

---

### Game framework
**LÖVE2D** : Lua framework for 2D games
**LibGDX** : Java framework for games

---

### Artistic instruments

# What we learned
## Game Design

---
### Minimum Viable Product
* Get feedback early
* Reduce wasted engineering hours
* Get a playful product as soon as possible

---

### Game design/development
* Setup -> Obstacles -> Goal
* "Don't punish the player"
* Seperate data and rendering
